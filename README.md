This is a simple and impractical book viewer. 

It's not really meant to be used by anyone but me; I can't imagine anyone except maybe GRRM finding it useful.

Basically you dump a bunch of sequentially numbered text files into the root directory and this thing parses them, builds an index page with links, and then displays formatted HTML.

There's a very lightweight syntax to defining titles, chapters, etc, as well.
